<h1>A Stunning Adventure</h1>      
<h2><a href="README.md">Where When Why and How?</a></h2>
<p>I've lots of stunning adventures to share but this paragraph is only to test the functionality of this repositories display on GitHub Pages</p>
<h2>Beyond The test</h2>
<p>Below is a list of things of no importance other than as a repository for writing about stunning adventures in my life.</p>

<h3>Gravity and Space</h3>
<p>I think I'm drawn to the exploration of space and gravity innately.
    Being aware of how i move through the world is important for me to be reminded to think about the physics of time and space. Thinking about the immensity of the universe and all of its unknowns keeps me wondering if there must be alternate realities and/or universes. Inter stellar communication must be possible, right? There must be some sort of frequency of communication that humans will probably never be able to detect because we don't have the brain power to imagine that something so stunning is possible.
Propreoception is a skill that must be practiced at all times. It's good for your mind, and it helps avoid physical injuries. Plus, practicing balance and posture techniques help to make a positive difference in other aspects of life. Being Propreoception aware releives anxiety, too.
</p>
<h3>Northwest Washington and Oregon</h3>
<p>Having been born on the Kitsap Peninsula was of great benefit for me. I've had many adventures on the Salish Sea. Surfing, Sailing, Fishing, respecting Mother Nature, it was all built in to the environment that helped my growth as a human thrive over the years.</p>

<p>
    There are too many stunning adventures to write about now. More soon, but a few morsals below.
</p>
<h3>Work adventures</h3>
<p>Many work adventures including KFC, Good Stuff, the Colophon Cafe, National 1 Hour Photolabs, Chris Leavitt Photography, Clemente Photography, the Boat Shed, Freedom, DaDa, Western.
The most stunning adventure in work was being a stay at home daddy the first 11 years of my sons life.
</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Talking about relationships might be out of scope for this write up of stunning adventures.
</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>There's an entire book regarding stunning adventures while navigating the world as a person experiencing vision loss stored away in my memory. There are stories of when i didn't know i was going to go blind, when i figured it out, what i did in bouts of extreme vision loss (sometimes the loss is more rapid than other times), some career choices along the way to now. </p>
<p>And some more interesting stories about driving, becoming disoriented on the beach after a long surfing session, Hackysack, Basketball, Soccer, Badminton, Pickleball, cell phones, screen readers, so much to talk about! Some travelling in planes, trains, and automobiles. There's also tennis ball cannons, long range touring on bicycles, being a professional photographer and videographer, being a waiter, being a manager, being a developer, being a good communicator, being a good father.
</p>
<h3>Now</h3>
<p>Now is a fun time to be working. it's almost like a stunning adventure each time i tackle a project. It's often fun, rewarding in many ways, and keeps me intelectually intrigued. Plus, it aims to help ensure people will have less struggles regarding digital and physical accessibility issues in the future. Baby steps towards progress
</p>
<p>
  There's more happening now, but I don't think it's in scope for this webpage at this time. Home maintanence, healthy eating and exercise, time for fun and creativity, strong work ethic, be kind. All very important considerations for a well lived life.
