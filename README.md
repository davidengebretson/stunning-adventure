# stunning-adventure
An adventure into publishing to GitHub Pages that turned into a repository for stories that I've written about. Some stunning adventures in my life are described, but beware the writing style may not be great..

## Stunning Adventures Listing
### Pulled to the Northwest
Not sure why, but I often find myself being most comfortable when my body is facing Northwest.
### Wash Cycle
Going through the wash cycle of a 16 foot wave can be very physically damaging, but it sure is humbling - good for the soul. Mother Ocean needs and deserves much respect.
### Waterbottle Theft
I often have a waterbottle setting in the side of my back when I travel. While in Cape Town, downtown, someone walked up behind me and tried to pull the water bottle out. I sensed it right away and stopped in my tracks, quickly turned around and said "what are you doing?" to the person. I also put my hand up in defense of my personal space. It landed directly on the persons chest and startled them a bit, i think. They dropped the water bottle and said, "you're crazy, what do you mean?" and ran off.
## About this Stunning Adventure
